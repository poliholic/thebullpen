I, per usual, and as one might expect, have no idea what I'm doing.

(that's self-deprecating humor YEEEDIOT...i totally have a very partial idea of what I'm doing...)

let FIUYMI = function(){
  console.log("Fake it until you make it.")
};

This site began as is followed along through this tutorial.

The narrator's linear, non-abstract, free-of-random-tangents manner was oddly understandable, but then dude finished his front-end with React, so we had to part ways.  

Improvisations from there. By "improvisations" I mean at one point I started over from scratch with completely new files.

I experimented with Handlebars with this guy's help:

I think that led to more complications than solutions.

Errors and TODOs are noted throughout the files.

I seem to have a lot of things fighting other things. Can't get elements to move with CSS, I'm sure bc of something the JS is doing. I can't get the Google fonts to import.

I think my JS division-of-labor is messed up. I've been consistently cross-pollenating app/index/server/api/routes/models/etc JS files.
